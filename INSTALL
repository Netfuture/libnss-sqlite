libnss-sqlite
=============

libnss-sqlite is a library which can be used to provide authentication
services using entries stored in a SQLite database. It has been tested
on a system with ~5k users and ~6k groups and has pretty good perfs
(less than one secon for an id xxxx). It is a good solution to mirror
a remote authentication database periodicaly updated avoiding connection
cost.

Last version is available from libnss-sqlite.tuxfamily.org.
Debian packages will be available soon.
